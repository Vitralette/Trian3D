# Trian3D in Matlab 

What we want to do 

    1. We have a sample project in Trian3D

    2. We want to take the Trian3D files of the sample project 
        - tif
            - these files represent digital elevation data 
            - various tif files generate a complete elevation surface 

    3. load in the tif files with matlab
         - they are located at TRIAN3D/SampleProject      
         - we also have the corresponding matlab object obtained by using geotiffinfo command in matlab, but since I dont have the toolbox we dont want to use the command and only make use of the already generated obejctes i obtained   
         - we also have the corresponding matlab object obtained by using readgeoraster command in matlab, but since I dont have the toolbox we dont want to use the command and only make use of the already generated obejctes i obtained 
         - decide which data which can use from which object or the original file to achive the goal  
         
    4. We need a matlab script that reproduces the eleation data in a surface plot or something similar
